    <p> My name is Russell Ott and I am a native of Texas. The early years of my childhood were spent in west Texas, my family moved to the DFW area when I was in elementray school. I graduated from the University of North Texas with a degree in Economics/Marketing.</p>  
    <p>I am currently in a full stack web development program at SMU. I plan to utilize the skills learned in this course to better myself and change my current career path. I feel that my background working for a large telecommunications company along with the skills learned in this development boot camp will give me a special blend of skills that I can use to excel in the 21st century.</p>
